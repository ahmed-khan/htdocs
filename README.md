## 📦 CI/CD Pipeline Process Automation

The diagram below illustrates a CI/CD pipeline that automates the deployment of code from a GitHub repository to an AWS Lightsail instance using GitHub Actions.

### Workflow Description:

1. **Code Development**: A developer writes and tests code on their local machine.
2. **Push to GitHub**: The code is pushed to a remote GitHub repository, which serves as the central version-controlled storage.
3. **Trigger GitHub Actions**: Upon detecting a code push, GitHub Actions initiates a workflow. This workflow can include steps for building, testing, and deploying the application.
4. **Deployment to AWS Lightsail**: The workflow uses secure access credentials (represented by key icons) to deploy the application to an AWS Lightsail instance.

### Key Concepts:

- **GitHub Actions**: The CI/CD tool that automates the workflow.
- **AWS Lightsail**: The cloud service where the application is deployed.
- **Secure Authentication**: Keys are used to securely authenticate and authorize the deployment process.

This setup ensures a seamless and automated deployment process, enabling developers to focus on writing code while the pipeline handles the rest.
