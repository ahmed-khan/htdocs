## 📁 CICD Pipeline Process Automation 
The image illustrates a CI/CD pipeline that automates code deployment from GitHub to AWS Lightsail, using GitHub Actions.

Description of Workflow:

	1.	GitHub User Writes Code: A developer writes code on their local machine.
	2.	Push Code to GitHub Repository: The developer pushes the code to a remote GitHub repository.  
	3.	GitHub Repository: This is the central place where the code is stored and version-controlled.    
	4.	GitHub Actions: Upon detecting a code push, GitHub Actions is triggered. It executes a workflow that could include building, testing, and deploying the application.   
	5.	Deployment to AWS Lightsail: The GitHub Actions workflow uses configured access credentials (represented by the key icon) to deploy the code from the GitHub repository to an AWS Lightsail instance.
Key Concepts:
	•	GitHub Actions is the CI/CD tool here.
	•	AWS Lightsail is the cloud service receiving the deployed application.
	•	Secure Keys (indicated by the key icons) are used to authenticate and authorize access between GitHub and AWS.

This setup represents an automated pipeline where every code push can result in a seamless deployment to AWS.
